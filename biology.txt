Cell Biology and Life Processes
Cell Structure:
- Cell Membrane: Controls what enters and exits the cell
- Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA)
- Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell, produces ATP energy
- Ribosomes: Protein synthesis
- Chloroplasts: Found in plant cells, performs photosynthesis
Photosynthesis:
- Process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy
- Takes place in chloroplasts
- Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2
- Requires: sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide
- Produces: glucose and oxygen
Cellular Respiration:
- Process that releases energy from glucose
- Occurs in mitochondria
- Equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP
- Opposite of photosynthesis
DNA Structure:
- Double helix shape
- Made of nucleotides (A, T, G, C)
- A pairs with T, G pairs with C
- Contains genetic instructions for all living organisms
Cell Division:
- Mitosis: Produces two identical daughter cells
- Meiosis: Produces four sex cells with half the chromosomes
- Used for growth, repair, and reproduction
